					<p>
						Python is a programming language used mainly for projects that
						include working with files, which contain numbers or lists, among
						other uses. Some examples of these could be:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Files that save balance sheets</li>
						<li>Data sheets with historical events numbers</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This is extremely useful when you want to study numbers from past
						events.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="CREATING_VARIABLES">
					<header>CREATING VARIABLES</header>
					<p>
						Variables in Python can be from many different types. Here are the
						three most common types of them and some examples.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>String</li>
						<li>Int</li>
						<li>Float</li>
					</ul>
					<fieldset>
						<code
							>name = "Maradona" #string <br />age = 63 #int <br />height = 1.65
							#float</code
						>
					</fieldset>
					<p>
						This are the 3 most used ones, you can find many more types like
						booleans, among others.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="PRINTS">
					<header>PRINTS</header>
					<p>
						When you declare a variable, the computer stores it's value. You can
						call it for it to be shown on screen at any time by using prints.
						The uses for prints are usually the following:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Showing the result of a code</li>
						<li>Giving updates as the code is working</li>
						<li>Debugging</li>
					</ul>
					<fieldset>
						<code>x = 10<br />y = 5<br />print(x + y)</code>
					</fieldset>
					<p>
						You can also do maths or formulate phrases inside prints, by
						following it's sintaxis.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="DEBUGGING">
					<header>DEBUGGING</header>
					<p>
						As a Python Developer, your code will encounter bugs very often.
						This can be caused by many different errors:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sintaxis error</li>
						<li>Undeclared variables</li>
						<li>Missing libraries</li>
						<li>Broken codes</li>
					</ul>
					<fieldset>
						<code
							>x = 10<br />while x>10<br />
							x = x + 1</code
						>
					</fieldset>
					<p>
						The code presented has many errors, like missing indentation, code
						that makes no sense and wrong sintaxis. A way to debug it could be
						adding prints among all the code to follow it step-by-step.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="main-section" id="ELSE_AND_IF">
					<header>ELSE AND IF</header>
					<p>
						The most common type of conditionals are else and if. These have the
						following functions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<i>IF: </i>checks if the condition given is true or false, and
							works based on the answer.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>ELSE: </i>followed by an if, adds another condition in case the
							first one isn't true.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<fieldset>
						<code
							>x = int(input())<br />if x>5:<br />print("is bigger than 5")<br />else:<br />print("is
							smaller or equal to 5")</code
						>
					</fieldset>
					<p>
						You can make it longer by adding ELIF's to the code. Here is an
						example following the previous code:
					</p>
					<fieldset>
						<code
							>x = int(input())<br />if (x>5):<br />print("is bigger than 5")<br />elif(x=5):<br />print("is
							equal to 5")<br />else():<br />print("is smaller than 5")</code
						>
					</fieldset>
					<p>
						This is the type of functions you will be using the most through
						your journey as a Python Developer, so you better get on well with
						them.
